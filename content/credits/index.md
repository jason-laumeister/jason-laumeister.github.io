Visit the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website!

This website is constructed using [Github Pages][github-pages] and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Read the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more details on how it works.

Thank you [Sergio Koppln][sergio-kopplin] for creating the [indigo][sergio-kopplin-indigo] Jekyll theme that is used as a base for this site. 

Inexpensive and adequate domain name registration can be had at [namesilo.com][namesilo].

Github pages are accessed over HTTP, but [Cloudflare][cloudflare] provides SSL support. Read ["Secure and fast GitHub Pages with CloudFlare"][cloudflare-github].

[Google Hosted Libraries][google-hosted-libs] are an excellent way to include common javascript libraries hosted on the Google CDN services. These are widely used, so it's likely that these are already in the browser cache of your target audience too.
