## How far can I commute?

I live in Santa Cruz County California, about one and a half hours south of San Francisco by car.

Below is a map of where I can comfortably commute on a daily basis. If the job location is outside of the red box, the work has to be very compelling for me to consider a regular commute. For awesome projects I've commuted as far north as San Francisco a few times a week.
