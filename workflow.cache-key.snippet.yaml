# The error message cache entry with the same key, version, and scope already exists and Failed to save: Unable to reserve cache with key hugo-16292276083, another job may be creating this cache. clearly indicates that your GitHub Actions workflow is trying to save a cache with a key that already exists.

# This usually happens when:

# Multiple jobs are running concurrently with the same cache key. If you have a matrix build or parallel jobs, they might all try to save to the same cache key at the same time.

# A previous workflow run failed during cache saving, leaving a stale cache entry. Less common, but possible.

# Your cache key generation is not unique enough for subsequent runs. This is the most likely scenario for a single job build process. The key hugo-16292276083 looks like it might be based on a timestamp that's not changing frequently enough, or perhaps the workflow is being re-run and the key is not being invalidated.

# Here's a breakdown of solutions, from simplest to more robust:

# Solutions to Cache Creation Error
# 1. Ensure Unique Cache Keys for Each Workflow Run (Most Common Cause)
# The primary key hugo-16292276083 suggests a static or not-so-dynamic key. For a Hugo site, you want the cache to be invalidated when the content, configuration, or Hugo version changes.

# A more robust cache key strategy for Hugo:

# You should combine elements that change when the cache needs to be invalidated. A common and effective approach is to hash files that influence the build, and include the Hugo version.

# Explanation of the key components:

# runner.os: Ensures a separate cache for different operating systems (e.g., Linux vs. Windows).

# hugo-: A prefix for clarity.

# hashFiles('**/go.mod', '**/go.sum', '**/package-lock.json', '**/yarn.lock'): This caches based on changes in your Go module dependencies (if you use Hugo Modules) or Node.js dependencies (if you use npm/yarn for front-end assets).

# hashFiles('config.toml', 'hugo.toml', 'content/**', 'layouts/**', 'static/**', 'themes/**'): This is crucial for Hugo. It ensures that the cache is invalidated if your Hugo configuration, content, layouts, static assets, or theme files change.

# github.sha: This is the SHA of the commit that triggered the workflow. It acts as a unique identifier for each commit, ensuring that every new commit gets a unique cache key (or restores from a very similar one if only minor changes occurred). This is your ultimate fallback for uniqueness.


# In your .github/workflows/hugo.yaml, modify the upload step to ensure a unique artifact name if thereâ€™s any chance of multiple runs, for example:

YAML
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: ./public
    name: github-pages-${{ github.run_id }}
Or, if only one upload should ever happen, review the workflow to make sure the upload step is not duplicated by mistake.

# Summary:

# Only one artifact named github-pages should be uploaded per workflow run.
# If you need more, use a unique name for each upload.
